## 📌 Project Overview

Welcome to the **Wallarm Solutions Engineer Technical Evaluation**. This exercise is designed to assess your ability to deploy and configure Wallarm's filtering nodes using a deployment method of your choice, troubleshoot any issues encountered, and document your process effectively. Additionally, we will evaluate your ability to leverage our official documentation to complete the task.


## 🚀 Task Overview

🔹 Ensure the backend is **reachable from the filtering node**.  

### 3️⃣ Generate Traffic Using GoTestWAF

🔹 Install and configure **GoTestWAF**.  
🔹 Send attack simulation traffic through the **Wallarm filtering node**.
