# Wallarm Solutions Engineer Technical Evaluation

## 📌 Project Overview

Welcome to my Wallarm submission repository. This is designed to assess my ability to deploy and configure Wallarm's filtering node solution being deployed with Kubernetes NGINX Ingress Controller, as well as troubleshoot any issues encountered, and document my process effectively. 

The solution will be tested with creating a backend origin and testing traffic with GoTestWAF. After test traffic has been simulated we can verify the results through the Wallarm Web Console. 

## 🚀 Task Overview

### 1️⃣ Deploy a Wallarm Filtering Node

🔹 Choose a [deployment method](https://docs.wallarm.com/installation/supported-deployment-options/) (**e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.**).  
🔹 Follow the [**official Wallarm documentation**](https://docs.wallarm.com/) to install and configure the filtering node.  
🔹 Verify that the filtering node is properly deployed and running.  

### 2️⃣ Set Up a Backend Origin

🔹 Configure a simple **backend API or web application** to receive traffic.  
🔹 Ensure the backend is **reachable from the filtering node**.  

### 3️⃣ Generate Traffic Using GoTestWAF

🔹 Install and configure **GoTestWAF**.  
🔹 Send attack simulation traffic through the **Wallarm filtering node**.  
🔹 Analyze the results and confirm that attacks are being detected.  

### 4️⃣ Document Your Process
